1. exploit Weak Permission on Service Configuration
- we can view the configuration of a service with the `sc.exe` 
```powershell
   sc.exe qc <services_name>
```

- To know if we have permission on the spcific service we can use
 Use the `accesschk64` program to check if we have privileges over that process.
install it > [accesschk64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk)

```powershell
   .\accesschk64 /accepteula -uwcqv <services_name>
```
